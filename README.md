# Hole-Mount Keystone Module Holder

This 3D model allows you to securely mount standard keystone modules, such as Ethernet jacks or USB ports, in tabletops or panels up to 20mm thick. Itâ€™s suitable for routing network or peripheral connections through desks, workstations, or other surfaces.

The model comes in several hole diameters: 30 mm, 32 mm, 38 mm, 40 mm, 44 mm, 50 mm, 54 mm, and 60 mm. The 60mm version includes a variant that fits two modules side by side. Please note that the 30 mm and 32 mm versions may not accommodate larger keystone modules, depending on their exact dimensions.

The design features a snap-in slot for the keystone module and a threaded exterior. To install, snap your keystone module into the holder, insert the holder into a round hole, and secure it from the back using the threaded ring.

This model is fully parametric and written in SwiftSCAD, allowing you to easily adjust parameters in the source code to fit your exact needs.

This model uses [SwiftSCAD](https://github.com/tomasf/SwiftSCAD) and [Helical](https://github.com/tomasf/Helical).
